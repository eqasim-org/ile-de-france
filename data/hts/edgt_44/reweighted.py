    # EDGT defines multiple weights. For comparison with EGT we keep them in the

    # because the initial person_weight is valid for all persons. However, EDGT
    # does only ask _one_ person per household for trips.. This means that some
    # people are registered with their sociodemographics, but _not_ with the
    # trips. We can identify them by searching for "is_respondent".
    # Now if we simply filter them out, we clearly reduce our weights (because
    # initially they fit EGT and census well). EDGT already defines weights which
    # are used for the "kish", i.e. the responding persons. At this point they
    # are saved in the data set as trip_weight. Probably it could make sense to
    # give this attribute a more descriptive name in the future.

    # 1) Filter persons for which we don't have trip information
