# Corsica

The pipeline makes it easy to create synthetic populations and simulations
for other regions than Île-de-France. In any case, we recommend to first
follow instructions to set up a [synthetic population for Île-de-France](../population.md)
and (if desired) the [respective simulation](../simulation.md). The following
describes the steps and additional data sets necessary to create a population and
simulation for **Corsica**.

## Additional data

### A) Buildings database (BD TOPO)

You need to download the region-specific buildings database.

- [Buildings database](https://geoservices.ign.fr/bdtopo)
- In the sidebar on the right, under *Téléchargement anciennes éditions*, click on *BD TOPO® 2022 GeoPackage Départements* to go to the saved data publications from 2022.
- The data is split by department and they are identified with a number. For Corsica, download:
  - Corse-du-Sud (2A)
  - Haute-Corse (2B)
- Copy the two *7z* files into `data/bdtopo_corsica`.

### B) OpenStreetMap data

Only if you plan to run a simulation (and not just generate a synthetic population),
you need to obtain additional data from OpenStreetMap.
Geofabrik provides a cut-out for the [Corsica](https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/france/corse.html) region: [corse-220101.osm.pbf](https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/france/corse-220101.osm.pbf). Download the region file in *.osm.pbf* format and put the file into the
folder `data/osm_corsica`.

### C) GTFS data

Again, only if you want to run simulations, the digital transit schedule is required.
Unfortunately, there is no consolidated GTFS schedule avaiable for the region of interest. Hence,
it is necessary to collect all relevant GTFS schedules one by one.

- [Chemins de fer de Corse](https://www.data.corsica/explore/dataset/horaires-cfc-gtfs/export/)
- [Cars Corse du Sud](https://www.data.corsica/explore/dataset/horaires-cars2a-gtfs/export/)
- [Cars Haute Corse](https://www.data.corsica/explore/dataset/gtfs-transport-horaires-cars-de-haute-corse/export/)

Download all the *zip*'d GTFS schedules and put them into the folder `data/gtfs_corsica`.


### D) Adresses database (BAN)

You need to download the region-specific adresses database :

- [Adresses database](https://adresse.data.gouv.fr/data/ban/adresses/latest/csv/)
- Click on the link *adresses-xx.csv.gz* where xx = departments codes (2A and 2B) 
- Copy the *gz* files into `data/ban_corsica`.


### Overview

Afterwards, you should have the following additional files in your directory structure:

- `data/bdtopo_corsica/BDTOPO_3-0_TOUSTHEMES_GPKG_LAMB93_D02A_2022-03-15.7z`
- `data/bdtopo_corsica/BDTOPO_3-0_TOUSTHEMES_GPKG_LAMB93_D02B_2022-03-15.7z`
- `data/ban_corsica/adresses-2A.csv.gz`
- `data/ban_corsica/adresses-2B.csv.gz`

*Only for simulation:*

- `data/osm_corsica/corse-220101.osm.pbf`
- `data/gtfs_corsica/GTFS été 2021.zip`
- `data/gtfs_corsica/cars2a-gtfs.zip`
- `data/gtfs_corsica/cars2b-gtfs.zip`

Note that the file names may change slightly over time as GTFS schedule are
updated continuously.

## Generating the population

To generate the synthetic population, the `config.yml` needs to be updated. 
By default the pipeline will filter all other data sets for the
Île-de-France region. To make it use the selected region, adjust the
configuration as follows:

```yaml
config:
  # ...
  regions: [94]
  # ...
```

This will make the pipeline filter all data sets for the Corsica region.

Finally, to not confuse output names, we can define a new prefix for the output files:

```yaml
config:
  # ...
  output_prefix: corsica_
  # ...
```

For the specific use case of Corsica, it makes sense to reduce the matching threshold between activity chains and persons as only little data for Corsica is available in the ENTD survey. This might be improved in the future by reusing data from other regions or using a more detailed HTS:

```yaml
config:
  # ...
  matching_minimum_observations: 5
  # ...
```

You can now enter your Anaconda environment and call the pipeline with the
`synthesis.output` stage activated. This will generate a synthetic population
for Corsica.

## Running the simulation

To prepare the pipeline for a simulation of Lyon, the paths to the OSM data sets and to the GTFS schedule must be adjusted explicitly:

```yaml
config:
  # ...
  gtfs_path: gtfs_corsica
  osm_path: osm_corsica
  ban_path: ban_corsica
  bdtopo_path: bdtopo_corsica
  # ...
```

To test the simulation and generate the relevant MATSim files, run the pipeline
with the `matsim.output` stage enabled.
