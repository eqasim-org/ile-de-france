## Synthetic population pipeline for ÃŽle-de-France
## based on the synpp package

# This is the path to a directory where the pipeline can store temporary data
working_directory: C:/Users/arthur.burianne/Documents/dev_simulations/emc2_tmp

# This section defines which parts of the pipeline should be run
run:
  - synthesis.output # To create the output population in the output_path (see below)
  #- documentation.paper # to create plots
  #- matsim.output # Uncomment, if you want to run the full simulation (you'll need Java for that)

# Here the configuraiton of the pipeline starts
config:
  # Some general configuration
  processes: 8

  # Define whether to use ENTD or EGT as the household travel survey (HTS)
  hts: emc2

  # Define sampling rate and random seed for the output population

  # Paths to the input data and where the output should be stored
