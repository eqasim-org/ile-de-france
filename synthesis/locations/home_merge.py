"""
This stage matches adresses from BAN with residential buildings from BD TOPO.
The match is based on distance from building shape perimeter in every direction 
(buffer expressed as meters in french EPSG:2154 projection). Distance value is 
default set to 5 meters and in most case is measured from 1 to 20 meters).
The output is one or several row(s) per buildings depending on match (one or 
many adresses). For every row of one buiilding the residences count is distributed
to matching adresses (i.e : Building A with 10 residences comes with 2 matching
adresses (A1 and A2), each of these two adresses are separeted rows in the output 
with 5 residences declared for draw).If no adresses matches a buidling it centroid
is taken as unique adress.
